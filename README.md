# LCC Device Data Analyzer

The repository contains the full-stack web development code of the website developed to assist the Bangladesh Agriculture Ministry in effectively monitoring and managing countrywide urea provision by storing and analyzing the data sent from the ['Smart LCC Device'](https://github.com/Dayan94/Smart-LCC-Device). The website analyzes and visualizes the sent data using bar charts and heat maps.
